Built a recommendation system by using cosine simillarties score. But the similarity scores are negligible (zeroes) between all the components. So, I also built recommendation system by using the Euclidean distances which gave some meaningful results.

The recommendation systems are built for the normal data as well as the normalized normalized data to get much more accurate results.
